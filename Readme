📊 Sales Analytics Engineering System
Profitability & Revenue Intelligence Platform

End-to-end analytics engineering project that transforms raw sales data into validated, business-ready analytical models using SQL and PostgreSQL.

🚀 Project Overview

Organizations often have sales data but lack trusted insights into profitability, growth trends, and regional performance.
This project simulates a real-world analytics engineering workflow where raw data is transformed into a clean, reliable analytics layer that supports:

Executive decision-making

BI reporting

AI / ML feature generation

🎯 Business Problem

The business faced the following challenges:

Sales data existed in raw Excel/CSV format

No clear visibility into:

Profit vs revenue

Product-level margins

Regional performance

Inconsistent and unvalidated data made reporting unreliable

Key questions stakeholders could not answer:

Which products are most profitable?

Which regions drive long-term revenue?

How is revenue trending over time?

🧩 Solution

Designed and implemented a SQL-based analytics engineering system that:

Ingests raw sales data

Applies data quality checks and validation

Transforms raw data into business-ready metrics

Exposes executive-level analytical views

Produces ML-ready time-series features

productName	Product name
productLine	Product category
buyPrice	Cost price
city	City of sale
country	Country of sale

✅ Data Quality & Validation

Implemented production-style data validation checks including:

NULL value detection

Duplicate order number detection

Negative price or quantity checks

Revenue vs cost consistency checks

Data quality is treated as a first-class concern, not an afterthought.

🔄 Transformations & Business Logic

Key transformations include:

Revenue calculation (quantity × price)

Cost aggregation

Profit computation

Standardized product and location dimensions

Raw data is converted into analysis-ready fact tables.

📈 Metrics Layer

Core business metrics designed:

Total revenue

Net profit

Profit margin

Revenue growth trends

Product and region performance

Metrics are defined centrally to ensure consistent reporting across teams.

🧠 Advanced Analytics

Used SQL window functions to enable:

Running totals

Month-over-month growth

Product profitability ranking

Regional performance comparisons

These queries support trend analysis and strategic decision-making.

👔 Executive-Ready Views

Created reusable SQL views for:

Monthly revenue trends

Top profitable products

Profit by product line

Country-level performance

These views are optimized for:

BI tools (Power BI / Tableau)

Executive dashboards

Ad-hoc analysis

🤖 AI & ML Readiness

The final analytical layer is designed to support AI/ML workflows by providing:

Clean time-series data

Feature-ready metrics

Consistent historical records

This data can directly feed:

Forecasting models

Anomaly detection systems

Pricing optimization models

🛠️ Tech Stack

Database: PostgreSQL

Language: SQL

Data Source: CSV / Excel

Tools: psycopg2, pandas

📌 Key Learnings

Analytics engineering is about trust and correctness

SQL is a system-design tool, not just a query language

Clean data enables better business and AI decisions

Metrics design is as important as technical implementation

🔮 Future Enhancements

dbt implementation

Incremental data loading

BI dashboard integration

AI-based anomaly detection

Automated data testing
